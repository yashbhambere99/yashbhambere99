# Concrete_Compressive_Strength_Prediction
To build a regression model to predict the concrete compressive strength based on the different features in the training data. 
The compressive strength of concrete ranges from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) for residential concrete and is high in commercial structures.
